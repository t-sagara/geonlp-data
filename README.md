===========

"GeoNLP" is a Japanese research project for developing "geo-tagging" tools and libraries, which can analyze and extract toponyms/location names from natural language sentences (currently only for sentences written in Japanese).

This repository contains some location name data files in GeoNLP format (basically CSV), for open maintenance.
These files are not complete and should be complemented such as blank lat/long fields.
Your contribution will be appriciated.

The GeoNLP project is also providing tools, libraries, toponym data sharing service, linked open data service and so on. For more detail, please visit https://geonlp.ex.nii.ac.jp/
